# Server Repository for Books Application

**Author**: Liza Oh & Steve Carpenter
**Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
Server side code for the Books application.

## Getting Started
This application needs to be paired with the client side code as well which
both will work hand in hand. Anyone interested in using this should clone both
repositories, npm install, the contents of package.json in the server repo,
and run nodemon to test locally. Then, in a browser, navigate to
https://localhost:3000

## Architecture
For this application, we are using Handlebarsjs, jQuery, NodeJS, npm, CSS,
HTML, JS, and the PostgreSQL database.
